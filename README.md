# Non-targeted-website-hacking
In many cases, hackers wonâ€™t specifically target your website. They will be targeting a vulnerability that exists for a content management system, plugin, or template.  For example, they may have developed a hack that targets a vulnerability in a particular version of WordPress, Joomla, or another content management system. They will use automated bots to find websites using this version of the content management system in question before launching an attack. They might use the vulnerability to delete data from your website, steal sensitive information, or to insert malicious software onto your server.  The best way to avoid website hacking attacks is to ensure your content management system, plugins, and templates are all up-to-date.
